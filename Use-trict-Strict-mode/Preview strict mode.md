# Strict Mode
- Strict mode - simply the mode that makes writing code safer. When using strict mode, in some cases, it will avoid writing code that is considered unsafe such as: 
- Forgot to use variable declaration keyword
- Avoid misplacing the names of parameters
- Error reporting in some cases it not allowed
- Cannot use some keywords that are confusing or are considered to be possible to be added to the language in the future

## 
- Error when reassigning value to attribute has writable : false
- Report an error when a function has parameter with the same name
- Declare the function in the code block, the function will be scoped
- Don't name variables, function names with some language 'sensitive' keywords

## Uses
- Avoid forgetting variable declaration 'keyword'
- Avoid duplication of variable names and logic errors
- Efficient memory usage because of avoiding variable creation 'global'
