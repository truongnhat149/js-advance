# Hoisting 
- Put variable declarations with var and function declarations to the top of the declared scope.
## Hoisting 'var' , 'function declarations'
- note: declaration is posted above, assignment is not

## Hoisting 'let', 'const'
{
    // code block
}
- note: declaring the variable 'let' when hoisted is not initialized and is included in the 'Template Dead Zone'
